- AI-powered responses for complex queries using your preferred AI provider
- QR code-based WhatsApp Web authentication
- Robust error handling and logging
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## Tech Stack & Libraries Used

This project brings together several modern technologies and open-source libraries:

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime powering the backend logic.
- **whatsapp-web.js**: The core library for interacting with WhatsApp Web, sending/receiving messages, and handling authentication.
- **puppeteer**: Controls a headless (or visible) browser to automate WhatsApp Web.
- **qrcode-terminal**: Renders QR codes in your terminal for easy WhatsApp authentication.
- **natural**: Provides natural language processing (NLP) capabilities for classifying and understanding simple messages.
- **openai**: Connects to OpenAI's API (or other AI providers) for advanced, AI-powered responses.
- **axios**: Handles HTTP requests, especially for AI API calls.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping your API keys and secrets safe.
- **sqlite3**: Lightweight, file-based database for storing all chat messages, sender names, and timestamps.

**Other requirements:**
- A WhatsApp account (for authentication)
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn (for dependency management)

> All libraries are open-source and can be easily swapped or extended to fit your needs. See `package.json` for exact versions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A WhatsApp account
- **API key for your preferred AI provider (e.g., DeepSeek, GPT, Gemini, Llama ,Claude, etc.)**

## Environment Setup: Storing Your API Key

Before running the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory to securely store your API key. This file should **not** be committed to version control if it contains real secrets.

1. In your project root, create a file named `.env`.
2. Add the following line, replacing the placeholder with your actual API key:
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key-here
   ```
   > If you use a different AI provider, use the appropriate environment variable name as required by your provider (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.).

3. Save the file. The application will automatically load this key at startup.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up WhatsApp Message Automation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WhatsApp-Message-Automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your AI provider API key. For example:
     ```
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key-here
     ```
     > Replace `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` with the correct variable name if your provider requires a specific one (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).

4. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Authenticate:**
   - Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal using WhatsApp Web on your phone.

6. **You're ready!**
   - The bot will now automatically respond to WhatsApp messages using your configured AI provider.

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign up with your chosen AI provider (such as DeepSeek, OpenAI GPT, Gemini, Llama Cloud, etc.).
2. Subscribe to a suitable plan if required and obtain your API key from the provider's dashboard.

> **Note:** Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient quota for usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd WhatsApp-Message-Automation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key. For example:
```
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key-here
```
> Replace `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` with the appropriate environment variable name if your provider requires a specific one (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Scan the QR code with WhatsApp Web to authenticate.

3. The bot will now automatically respond to messages:
   - Common messages (greetings, farewells, thanks) using NLP
   - Complex queries using your configured AI provider

## Database (Message Storage)

All incoming WhatsApp messages are automatically stored in a local SQLite database file named `chats.db` in the project root. Each entry includes:
- **Sender's name** (or number if name is unavailable)
- **Message content**
- **Timestamp** (when the message was received)

**Table schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    sender_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## How to Access the SQLite Database

Your WhatsApp messages are stored in a file called `chats.db` in your project's root folder. You can view and explore this data in several easy ways:

### 1. Using the SQLite Command Line (CLI)
If you have SQLite installed on your computer:

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to your project folder.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   sqlite3 chats.db
   ```
3. At the SQLite prompt, type:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM messages;
   ```
   This will show all stored messages, including sender names and timestamps.

### 2. Using a Graphical Tool (Recommended for Beginners)
If you prefer a visual interface, use a free tool like:

- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/)

**Steps:**
1. Download and install your chosen tool.
2. Open the tool and use "Open Database" to select `chats.db` from your project folder.
3. Browse the `messages` table to see all your stored chats, sender names, and timestamps.

### 3. From Node.js (for Developers)
You can add a function to your code to print all messages to the console. For example, in `src/services/db.service.js`:

```js
function printAllMessages() {
    db.all('SELECT * FROM messages', [], (err, rows) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(rows);
    });
}
```
Call `printAllMessages()` from your code to see the data in your terminal.

**Tip:**
If you ever want to export your data (e.g., to CSV), both the CLI and GUI tools offer export options.
